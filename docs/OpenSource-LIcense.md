The three core terms of the BSD3 license

##  Three   Clause

If you use or distribute code based on the BSD3 license in your software, you must comply with these conditions:

Main Features of the BSD 3-Clause License

1. Highly Permissive:

Unlike copyleft licenses such as the GPL (General Public License), the BSD 3-Clause License does not require you to release modifications or derivative works based on the code as open source.

You can use code licensed under BSD 3 in proprietary (closed-source) software and commercial products without having to disclose your source code.

2. Business-Friendly:

Due to its permissive nature, many companies (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Apple) prefer using code under the BSD 3-Clause License in their internal projects and commercial products.

3. Encourages Distribution and Reuse:

Its low barrier allows developers to easily use and share code, thereby fostering rapid technological development and innovation.

Summary

In conclusion, the BSD 3-Clause License is a simple, flexible, and highly business-friendly open-source agreement. Its greatest advantage is that it allows users almost unrestricted use of the code, including integrating it into closed-source commercial software. The only "cost" is respecting the original authors' rights (retaining the copyright notice and not using their names for promotion without permission).
