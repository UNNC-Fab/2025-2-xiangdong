The three core terms of the BSD3 license

##  Three   Clause

If you use or distribute code based on the BSD3 license in your software, you must comply with these conditions:

The BSD3-Clause License is a widely used open-source software license. It is a very lenient license, meaning that it imposes very few restrictions on the use, modification and distribution of the software.

Its name is derived from its origin: the "Berkeley Software Distribution" version of the University of California, Berkeley, which was an early variant of the Unix operating system.

The three core terms of the BSD3 license

As the name suggests, "3-Clause" refers to the fact that it contains three main clauses. If you use or distribute code based on the BSD3 license in your software, you must comply with these conditions:

1. Retain the original copyright notice and terms

In any source code or binary (compiled) form you distribute, the original copyright notice, the list of license terms, and the disclaimer below must be included.

2. It is prohibited to use the contributor's name to endorse or promote derivative works

This is the second clause and also the main difference from the older "BSD 4-Clause License". It stipulates that without prior written permission, the name of the original author or contributor shall not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software.

3. Disclaimer

This is a standard legal statement clearly stating that the software is provided "as is" without any form of warranty. If there are any problems with the software, the author or the copyright owner shall not be held responsible.
Main Features of the BSD 3-Clause License

1. Highly Permissive:

Unlike copyleft licenses such as the GPL (General Public License), the BSD 3-Clause License does not require you to release modifications or derivative works based on the code as open source.

You can use code licensed under BSD 3 in proprietary (closed-source) software and commercial products without having to disclose your source code.

2. Business-Friendly:

Due to its permissive nature, many companies (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Apple) prefer using code under the BSD 3-Clause License in their internal projects and commercial products.

3. Encourages Distribution and Reuse:

Its low barrier allows developers to easily use and share code, thereby fostering rapid technological development and innovation.

Summary

In conclusion, the BSD 3-Clause License is a simple, flexible, and highly business-friendly open-source agreement. Its greatest advantage is that it allows users almost unrestricted use of the code, including integrating it into closed-source commercial software. The only "cost" is respecting the original authors' rights (retaining the copyright notice and not using their names for promotion without permission).
MIT license

#   The differences between BSD3 and MIT

1.MIT license

The MIT license is the simplest and least restrictive among all open source licenses. It has only one requirement:

The original copyright notice and MIT license text must be included in your software copy or important parts.

Besides this, you can do almost anything:

You can use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense and sell the software.

You can use the code for private or commercial closed-source projects without making your source code public.

Why choose MIT?

Developers usually choose MIT because they hope their code can be disseminated and used to the greatest extent possible, whether it's for personal projects, internal company projects or commercial products, and they don't want to set any obstacles.

2. BSD 3-Clause License

The BSD 3-Clause license adds an extra clause on the basis of the MIT license. It has three requirements:

When redistributing the source code, the original copyright notice, license terms and disclaimer must be retained.

When redistributing binary formats (such as compiled programs), the above copyright notice, license terms and disclaimer must be copied in the documentation or other provided materials.

Without prior written permission, the name of the original author or contributor may not be used to endorse or promote derivative works.

This third point is the sole and most crucial difference from the MIT license. It is also known as the "No Endorsement" clause.
